**ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES**

This is a collection of various projects I have worked on since the beginning of 2024. With the intention of practicing the implementation of fundamental data structures and
advanced algorithms. 

This collection consists of a variety of data structures and algorithms that have been implemented to acomplish a variety of tasks. 
Unless specified otherwise, implementation is in C++.

Data Structures including:

- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists

Trees:
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps

Search Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
